  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works of the Software;
  c. to distribute copies of the Software and Derivative Works;
  d. to display the Software publicly;
  e. to perform the Software publicly; and

2. **Grant of Patent License**. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Software as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Software and Derivative Works.

3. **Grant of Source Code License**. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Software for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another well known, available software program. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Software to You if You request it in writing. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Software.

4. **Exclusions From License Grant**. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Software, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Software without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer for sale embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Software that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5. **External Deployment**. The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Software or Derivative Works in any way such that the Software or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether the Software or Derivative Works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Software or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

6. **Attribution Rights**. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of license or any descriptive text giving attribution to any contributor(s) to the Software, or the disclaimer of warranties. You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent attribution to the author(s) of the Original Work, reasonably calculated to inform recipients that the Original Work has been modified.

7. **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty**. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights or patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Software is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Software and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. **Limitation of Liability**. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Software including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9. **Acceptance and Termination**. If You distribute copies of the Software or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Software or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

10. **Attorneys Fees**. In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

11. **Miscellaneous**. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

12. **Definition of "You" in this License**. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

13. **Right to Use**. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
